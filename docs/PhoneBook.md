You can define a list of phone extensions for your Cloud PBX, plus create abbreviated dialing for external phone numbers.

You can set up dialing rules as an international prefix, outside prefix, direct number (e.g. 911), or abbreviated dialing for your accounts.

| Phone numbers must be entered in the E.164 format. |

You can assign a short number the end users will dial on their phones. The maximum number length is limited to 15 characters.

| A speed dial must not coincide with an extension number for the system to correctly convert the number where to route the call. |
