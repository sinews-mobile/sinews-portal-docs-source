# Two-factor authentication

You can significantly increase the security level of your portal users' access to the Cloud PBX portal by using two-factor authentication (2FA). With enabled 2FA, users can log in only after entering a valid one-time password (OTP) in addition to their login and regular password. The time-based OTP is generated by a 2FA application, such as Google Authenticator, installed on the user’s smartphone. So, even if an unauthorized person gains access to user credentials, they can’t access the Cloud PBX portal without the OTP.

## Enable two-factor authentication for your own user

If you want to add an extra layer of security to your login and password, install an authenticator application on your mobile device (e.g. Google Authenticator: Android, iOS) and open menu "My company > My profile" or simply click on your login in the left bottom corner of the page. Open tab "Security" to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your own user. Scan the QR code or manually enter the shown key to your authenticator application. The authenticator application will then generate a one-time password that you need to enter below the QR code.

Now, two-factor authentication (2FA) has been configured for your login.

During the next login attempt by that user, they will be asked to scan a QR code and enter an OTP code.

## Reset a two-factor authentication key

If you need to replace your mobile device where you installed your authenticator application, you can reset your two-factor authentication key. Open menu "My company > My profile" or simply click on your login in the left bottom corner of the page. Open tab "Security" to reset two-factor authentication (2FA) key for your own user. You will be asked to enter an OTP code.
