### Important news about the roadmap and next steps from our side:
 - We're working on upload of extensions from CSV to simplify the onboarding of new customers. Since upload from CSV requires PortaSwitch MR106, updates to 0.58.0 will be postponed until your PortaSwitch is updated.
 - We are evaluating possible solutions for the documentation of the portal.
 - If you are interested in having documentation on your own domain name or in translation to other languages - please reach out to us.
